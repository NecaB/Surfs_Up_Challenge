The temperature results for December were a minimum monthly temperature of 56.0(F), a maximum of 83.0(F), with an average of 71.0(F). 

The standard deviation for temperatures in June was smaller at (3.26) while the standard deviation for December was (3.75). This accounts for temperature fluctuations, thus proving the temperature ranges in June are lesser and thus making June warmer in comparison to December, which was colder, this was shown by the larger range in temperature. 

June was usually hotter than December as expected, but June and December had very close maximum temperatures 85.0(F) and 83.0(F) respectively. Additionally, the coldest June temperature was 8.0(F) more than the 56.0(F) of December.

A query to gather more weather data to analyze the precipitation levels to further demonstrate the difference in the rainy days in June and December so the client may be able to capitalize on tourism.  This could be an opportunity for better business prospects for the client. 

An additional query to also determine the potential of Natural Disasters or extreme weather conditions during the months. The seasons for hurricanes, cyclones and Tsunamis are typically before December and could prove hazardous for business, even though the climate is warmer and would suggest more favourable for tourist related businesses.
